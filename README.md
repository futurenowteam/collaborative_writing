# Collaborative writing

Today you are going to write a short story but unfortunately, because of time constraints, youâ€™ll need to enlist the help of your teammates.

Everyone in the group is going to clone this repository and one by one each of you will write the next sentence. In the end you will have a story that starts off with the sentence we give you and finishes with what you and your group writes.


## Assignment

1. Everyone in the group clones this repository.
2. One person pulls the most recent changes, edits the text file, writes the next sentence, makes a commit, and pushes the changes up.
3. Repeat Step 3 until everybody has done it.
